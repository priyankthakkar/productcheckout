## **PRODUCT CHECKOUT**

This application is created using **create-react-app.**

To start this application, unzip it on local drive, go the project folder and execute following commands:

**Install**

> yarn install

**Start**

> yarn start

**Test**

> yarn test

The application should start by **default on a port 3000**

> URL to visited should be: http://localhost:3000/checkout

**React eco-system used is: React, reactstrap, Redux, Redux Saga, Jest, Enzyme, Styled Components**

In terms of ESLint, I have tried to follow **eslint-airbnb** config rule as closely as possible.

Whenever APIs were required, I have used a mocking solution from JSON Placeholder from typicode.
